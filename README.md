# TimeSeries_Deep-Learning
Estimating energy consumption in Megawatts (MW)
In this kernel I will provide all the steps required for doing time series analysis using time series data and simple RNN, LSTM models and their hybrid.
You can see the performance of simple RNN model, LSTM model, hybrid model and compare their performance
